      <description>Meta This post is my team&amp;rsquo;s 2021 NFL Big Data Bowl submission. My team was made up of me, Hugh McCreery (Baltimore Orioles), John Edwards (Seattle Mariners), and Owen McGrattan (DS student at Berkeley). I&amp;rsquo;m proud of what we&amp;rsquo;ve put forth here, and hopefully you find it interesting. At the end (after the Appendix), I&amp;rsquo;ve added some overall thoughs on things we were curious about or feel like we could have done better, as well as what we view as the biggest strengths and weaknesses of our submission.</description>
