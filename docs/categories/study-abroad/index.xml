      <description>This is a blog post Q&amp;amp;A I wrote for the Swedish Program blog. You can find the original post here.
Housing is a big part of your study abroad experience. At The Swedish Program, we offer students the choice of an apartment or host family, both of which provide opportunities for cultural integration. It can be tough to decide which option is right for you, so we asked Fall 2019 student Matt Kaye (Carleton College â€˜19) to describe his experience living with a host family.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m now finishing up my third week in Stockholm &amp;ndash; time flies. Week 1 was mostly orientation: learning a little bit of Swedish, meeting the other group members, starting to find our way around the city, etc. We trekked out to Sandhamn, an island in the Archipelago, for the first weekend. Really beautiful spot. Weeks 2 and 3 were the start of classes &amp;ndash; 3 program classes and 1 SSE class.</description>
