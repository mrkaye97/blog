[{"content":"This is a blog post Q\u0026amp;A I wrote for the Swedish Program blog. You can find the original post here.\nHousing is a big part of your study abroad experience. At The Swedish Program, we offer students the choice of an apartment or host family, both of which provide opportunities for cultural integration. It can be tough to decide which option is right for you, so we asked Fall 2019 student Matt Kaye (Carleton College ‘19) to describe his experience living with a host family.\nTell us about your host family. I lived with the Grahm family in Bromma (about 30 minutes west of SSE by metro). Jonas is a consultant and Sara is a chemist. They have three kids named Benjamin, Truls, and Wilhelm, who are 14, 12, and 12, and play lots of sports and video games.\nWhy did you choose to live with a host family? I spent a month and a half in A Coruña, Spain the summer after my sophomore year in high school. Our entire group on that program lived with host families, and I think that everyone would have agreed that the homestay was at least one of the highlights, if not the best part of the experience. For me, opting to live with a family again in Stockholm was a no-brainer.\nHow was your first week after moving in? Moving in always feels a little awkward. Not only are you in a totally new place, but you’re also in someone else’s home. It takes a little while to get used to that. I was lucky to be the fifth student that my family has hosted here, so they were very welcoming and knew exactly what to expect, which was nice. In general, getting acclimated was really easy – especially during the second week when I settled into a routine and just became another member of the family.\nDescribe a typical day with your host family. Normally Sara, Truls, and I are awake around 6:30 and having breakfast around 7:00. I’ll go to school and get back whenever: sometimes 3:00, sometimes closer to 6:00, but generally before dinner. Since I like to cook, I normally help out with dinner when I get home. Nights can be a little hectic because the kids have sports and other activities going on, but they’ve made an effort to try to have dinner as a family whenever possible. After dinner there is usually a lot of homework being done (which I get to help with if it’s math or English) and TV and movies (generally English with Swedish subtitles, because nothing is dubbed here) being watched before bed.\nWhat was the best part about living with a host family? This is a tough one because there are a lot. Aside from getting to build relationships with the whole family were the numerous opportunities I’ve had to meet other Swedes. I think that I got lucky because my family is particularly well-connected, but an example: they have dinner parties – either at home or somewhere else – basically every weekend. Sometimes it’s a summer night dinner event where everyone on the block brings tables, chairs, and food from their house and sets it all up outside on the street, and sometimes it’s just us and one other family.\nIt especially struck me how much of an effort everyone – that isn’t an overstatement, literally everyone – made to speak English rather than Swedish when I was around, whether just standing around having a drink, cooking, or at the dinner table with 15 other people, to make sure I was included in the conversation. That didn’t go unnoticed, and I’m unbelievably grateful.\nWhat were you most nervous about, or what was the most challenging? Given that I had lived with a host family before, I wasn’t very nervous. I think the most challenging thing, though, has been getting the two younger kids, Truls and Wilhelm, to feel comfortable around me. They’re a little shy and I recognize that it can be tough having an annoying American college kid join the family for a few months, so it was a little tricky at first. After the first month or so they started getting more used to me and opened up more, which has been really great.\nWhat are you going to miss the most? Definitely just being a part of the family. It’s been really awesome getting to know them and leaving will be hard. I’ve felt really at home here, especially the last few months after getting settled in.\nWhat’s your advice to future students who are considering choosing a host family? Obviously, do it. It completely changes the experience that you’ll have here. Like I said before, I’m eternally grateful for all of the great opportunities that I’ve had because of having chosen to live with a host family.\n","date":"2019-12-01","permalink":"https://mrkaye97.github.io/blog/post/2019-12-01-host-family-q-a/","tags":["host family","stockholm","study abroad"],"title":"Host Family Q\u0026A"},{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;m now finishing up my third week in Stockholm \u0026ndash; time flies. Week 1 was mostly orientation: learning a little bit of Swedish, meeting the other group members, starting to find our way around the city, etc. We trekked out to Sandhamn, an island in the Archipelago, for the first weekend. Really beautiful spot. Weeks 2 and 3 were the start of classes \u0026ndash; 3 program classes and 1 SSE class. Overall, so far, so good.\nA few of the biggest highlights so far:\n Meeting my host family. They\u0026rsquo;re great! Very welcoming and we\u0026rsquo;ve been getting along super well. Dinner parties. One of the biggest perks of living with a host family is getting opportunities to meet some Swedes. I got to go to 3(!) dinner parties in the first two weeks of being here. The biggest takeaway: families here are just like families at home. Getting to see some of Stockholm, especially Gamla Stan (the old town). The city itself is amazing. Tons of great architecture and food, it\u0026rsquo;s clean and easy to get around, and there\u0026rsquo;s lots to do. SATS. The Swedish Program gets us a (~$100 / month in value) membership to SATS, a Scandinavian gym chain. It\u0026rsquo;s like the Equinox of Stockholm.  Some things I\u0026rsquo;ve learned so far:\n The Swedish attitude towards work is VERY different from the American attitude. Same for their attitude towards the government. Classes at SSE work a little differently than at Carleton (obviously). My SSE economics course (International Economics with Prof. Paul Segerstrom) is a 300-kid lecture. Maybe only half of the students show up, and the only assessment is a final exam. The material seems fine \u0026ndash; it\u0026rsquo;s a first course in trade. More interesting, though, is the number of editorial (and controversial, in my view) comments that he makes about a variety of topics during the lecture.  Now, the days are starting to get a little darker as we chug along towards the start of winter. So it goes.\n","date":"2019-09-09","permalink":"https://mrkaye97.github.io/blog/post/2019-9-9-first-weeks-in-stockholm/","tags":["travel","study abroad","europe"],"title":"First Weeks in Stockholm"},{"content":"How fast eighteen days can go by is unbelievable. This trip has been really awesome for me: I\u0026rsquo;ve seen new parts of the world and experienced new cultures, got to meet really cool people from all over the globe, and gained important knowledge for future solo travels. But first, Vienna and Salzburg.\nI spent yesterday roaming around Vienna and then heading over to Schonbrunn Palace, the old seat of the Austrian Empire. The palace and gardens were impressive \u0026ndash; comparable to Versailles. The audio-guided tour of the inside was a little underwhelming, but I did learn that Schonbrunn played host to a meeting between Kennedy and Kruschev. I\u0026rsquo;m a little sick of bratwurst and goulash so I got ramen for dinner, which was a nice change of pace (although not as good as Santouka in Boston).\nToday I woke up at 6 to catch a 7:07 train to Salzburg. The train, going about 120 miles per hour, took about two and a half hours. Why can\u0026rsquo;t Amtrak be that efficient? Salzburg is beautiful. My first stop was the Mirabelle Gardens, which are famously the location of the Do-Re-Mi scene in The Sound of Music. After seeing the Gardens, I hiked uphill to Salzburg Fortress, which offers stunning views of the medieval and Gothic buildings of the city with mountains in the background. As usual, I\u0026rsquo;ll try to link some photos later, but it\u0026rsquo;s worth looking up the view.\nNow I\u0026rsquo;m back in Vienna and am about to start packing up for my journey home tomorrow, so I want to take a little time to wrap up, share what I\u0026rsquo;ve learned, and list out the highlights of the trip.\nFirst, the highlights. There are a few clear winners here. Auschwitz, although not my most fun day was definitely one well spent for people making their way to Krakow. Also in Krakow, Wawel Castle and the Market Square were both beautiful, and a walking tour or just a stroll around to see the two will be a half-day well spent, One more point for Krakow: the Christmas market was awesome. Really, this goes for all of the places I went. The Christmas markets were a great way to get caught up in the holiday cheer and interact with some locals. All of the Christmas markets that I went to were well worth the trips, and I often found myself going back for another meal or mulled wine. Next, Budapest as a whole was amazing. It was definitely my favorite city on the trip. There are a ton of things to do \u0026ndash; I had four days and don\u0026rsquo;t feel like I exhausted all of my options \u0026ndash; and there is great culture and nightlife. Some specific highlights from Budapest were the Parliament Building, which remains the most stunning building I\u0026rsquo;ve ever seen, and Buda Castle with its views out over the river and said Parliament Building. For nightlife, Szimpla was really cool, and I would definitely recommend at least checking out one of the Ruin Bars, if not Szimpla specifically. Finally, Salzburg Fortress offered incredible views out over the city and mountains, and I would destiny rely recommend Salzburg as a day trip for anyone with some time on their hands in Vienna.\nNow, on to a few things that I\u0026rsquo;ve learned along the way. I will try to make this into bullet points when I get home, but, again, I don\u0026rsquo;t know how to do that on my phone. Bear with me. First, meeting other people can make or break a solo trip. This means that staying in social hostels is critical if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to spend your nights alone at the bar or in bed (and if you do, that\u0026rsquo;s okay, too!). My hostel in Vienna (Wombats' Naschmarkt) was WAY too big. It was impossible to meet people, and it seemed like everyone here was in groups already, including a group of about 40 high school-aged girls, which I found a little weird. On the other hand, my hostels in Krakow and Budapest (Greg and Tom Beer House and Hostel One Basilica, respectively) were awesome. There were tons of solo travellers and people in small groups, and the hostels had great common spaces and organized events like family dinners to help meet people. I made friends with a bunch of other travellers as soon as I arrived, and they became companions in checking out the city and going out bar hopping. This really made Krakow and Budapest into amazing experiences for me, and I\u0026rsquo;m grateful to have had the opportunity to meet and talk to all kinds of cool people from all over the world. On packing: my backpack was great, but I packed the wrong ratio of clothes. I think that two pairs of pants and as many pairs of socks and underwear as you want days before doing wash is the sweet spot, with half as many shirts as pairs of underwear. Packing this way means that all of your clothes will be dirty at the same time, and you won\u0026rsquo;t have to wash individual items like I did. Lastly, aside from booming popular attractions in advance, basically all other plans can be made last-minute. This means that going forward my approach will probably be to figure out roughly what I want to see and book those sights, and then make sure I get to those places on those days, filling in everything in between by being flexible. Hostels and transportation can be hooked one day in advance or even the day of (maybe except during times like NYE), which means that spending an extra day somewhere is no big deal, and deciding you\u0026rsquo;ve seen it all and want to leave early is equally easy.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s back to school for me now, and many thanks for following along with my trip. I\u0026rsquo;ve had a really awesome time and can\u0026rsquo;t wait for the next time I get to do this!\n","date":"2019-01-03","permalink":"https://mrkaye97.github.io/blog/post/2019-1-3-last-days/","tags":["travel","solo","solo travel","europe"],"title":"Last Days"},{"content":"Another week has already gone by! It\u0026rsquo;s amazing how fast the time goes \u0026ndash; I\u0026rsquo;ll be back at school this time next week. It was a snowy Christmas in Krakow, and pretty much the whole city was closed down. Wawel Castle was a highlight \u0026ndash; a really old castle with great views out over the city. Kazimierz, the Jewish Quarter, home of a circuit of old synagogues that survived the War, was also interesting. Our walking tour guide said that Kazimierz was populated with criminals after the War and was the seedy area of the city at the time, but has since become Krakow\u0026rsquo;s nightlife hub, playing gist to hundreds of bars and restaurants. The two days that followed were day trips to Zakopane, a small ski resort town near the Slovakian border, and the Wieliczka Salt Mine. Neither were particular highlights.\nThe next experience was an overnight train from Krakow to Budapest. I got to the station at 10:30 and got on to find two other (Polish?) people in my 7x4 foot compartment with a triple bunk bed. One of them was in the bottom bunk and the other was in the top, leaving the middle for me. That overnight train was a stuffy first for me, but I was glad to have saved the eight-or-so daytime hours that it would have taken otherwise.\nI woke up in Budapest and headed straight to the Rudas Baths, which are a somewhat more modest version of the famous Szecheyni Baths. It was an interesting experienc: basically seven hot tubs of various temperatures with a bunch of half-naked men in them (Friday is man-only at Rudas). There were some saunas, stream rooms, and other pools, too. After about two hours I opted to go hunting for some food.\nBudapezt, at least per the Internet, is somewhat famous for cakes. With this in mind, I tried a few different cafés over my four days that were recognized in multiple \u0026ldquo;Best Cake in Budapest\u0026rdquo; lists. The first of these was chimney cake, which I had also seen in Prague and Krakow but hadn\u0026rsquo;t tried. It was basically a hollow piece of dough coated in some cinnamon and chocolate, and definitely wasn\u0026rsquo;t the best dessert item that I\u0026rsquo;ve had on this trip. However, after finishing the massive cylinder-shaped pastry, I headed over to the Christmas market in front of St. Stephen\u0026rsquo;s Basilica, which was definitely on-par with the markets in Vienna and Krakow. It was absolutely packed with people, with stands serving everything from mulled wine to Langos to fried duck thighs and drum sticks. More on Langos later, but during this specific visit I tried the duck, which was very good.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve slowly been getting used to the sun setting at 3:30 or 4, so as it started getting dark I headed towards the Hungarian Parliament Building. Simply put, it\u0026rsquo;s the single most amazing building I\u0026rsquo;ve ever seen. I\u0026rsquo;ll embed photos of it later, some of which I took during this first time seeing it.\nThe next day, I trekked up the hill on the Buda side of the city (it\u0026rsquo;s split into Buda and Pest) to see some old ruins with a panoramic view of the city, Buda Castle, and the Fisherman\u0026rsquo;s Bastion. More castles and churches, pretty much, but definitely worth seeing. The highlight of the day, though, was Szimpla, Budapest\u0026rsquo;s oldest \u0026ldquo;ruin bar.\u0026rdquo; The ruin bars are essentially old abandoned warehouses and other buildings that are furnished with a bunch of random stuff from thrift stores and local srtists, and have been decorated with locks, stickers, and hand-written notes by the bars' patrons. It\u0026rsquo;s a really cool concept, and something that I\u0026rsquo;m a little surprised that we don\u0026rsquo;t have more of at home. Szimpla and the other ruin bars are far-and-away the most popular nightlife spots in the city, and for good reason. We showed up early (by Budapest standards, at least) at around 11, and there was a ten-minute line out the door. The bar itself was completely full, mostly of tourists. There were about ten individual bars serving different types of drinks and only a handful of tables for people to sit, which we were lucky to get one of. Szimpla was definitely a highlight of the trip so far. I had never seen anything like it before, and the atmosphere was awesome.\nAfter another 10AM wake-up, I went to another American-style brunch place \u0026ndash; these are apparently becoming popular in Budapest \u0026ndash; and then trekked out to the auburbs. All of the old Communist statues from Hungary\u0026rsquo;s tumultuous past were banished to Memento Park, about an hour outside of the city by a combination of metros, trams, and buses. It was small, but pretty fascinating. A thirty-foot statue of Lenin greets visitors at the gate, and there are others that are even taller that were removed from the city after the Communist regimes fell. After another cake, I headed to the House of Terror museum to learn more about the two major authoritarian regimes that ruled Hungary for half of a century. The line outside took about an hour, and the museum was underwhelming. Their main way of conveying information was on 8.5 x 11 sheets of paper with paragraphs and paragraphs written on them for visitors to read either as they were walking or while standing around in one of the rooms. I\u0026rsquo;d never seen that in a museum before, and it didn\u0026rsquo;t make a whole lot of sense.\nOn my fourth day, I opted to wake up early to try to buy a ticket for a tour of the Parliament. I got there around 7:45 and got a ticket (they were sold on a first come, first served basis for anyone who neglected to book in advance). The inside of the building was impressive, but could not rival the impressive facade. After that tour, I headed over to the second-largest synagogue in the world \u0026ndash; and the largest in Europe \u0026ndash; and was happy to find that the line that had been about two blocks long the day before was virtually nonexistent. I spent maybe 15 minutes inside, but there wasn\u0026rsquo;t a lot to see. The two remaining activities for the day were seeing the main market hall in the city and Heroes Square. The market was underwhelming. Somewhat reminiscent of the municipal markers of Madrid but crawling with tourists eating microwaved food, I opted to head out not long after I arrived. Heroes Square was impressive, but also packed with tourists (again, photos will be attached at some point). The park begin the square is home to a huge ice rink, a castle, a Christmas market, and the famous Szechenyi Thermal Baths, which is probably the biggest tourist attraction in the city for being uniquely Budapest. I skipped it, after hearing reviews ranging from negative to ambivalent from the other hostellers.\nFinally, last night was New Year\u0026rsquo;s Eve! The hostel was organizing an open bar and a trip to a club for about $30, but a few Aussies and I opted to head to the Chain Bridge instead. The Chain Bridge is the most famous bridge across the Danube in the city, and there must have been over 100,000 people on the bridge and on the two banks of the Danube ready to celebrate the new year with fireworks, champagne, and, in one very Spanish case, grapes! It was a once-in-a-lifetime type of experience, and I\u0026rsquo;m glad that I went.\nSorry for the length of this one. It was a week since I last posted. Next stop, Austria!\n","date":"2019-01-01","permalink":"https://mrkaye97.github.io/blog/post/2019-1-1-krakow-and-budapest/","tags":["travel","solo","solo travel","europe"],"title":"Krakow and Budapest"},{"content":"I have 20 minutes before my bus from Auschwitz to Krakow leaves, so I figured I have time to write another post!\nI took a train from Vienna to Prague a few days ago to meet up with a friend who was doing abroad there. I slept through most of the ride, so I don\u0026rsquo;t have much to say on that other than that the Czech countryside \u0026ndash; or the parts of it that I saw, at least \u0026ndash; were very pretty. Rolling hills, light dusting of snow, lots of trees and streams, etc. I roamed around for a little bit in Prague before meeting up with my friend. His apartment was in Andel, which was a neighborhood a little bit off the beaten path. A lot of Czech, and not much English going on there. They had Starbucks, McDonald\u0026rsquo;s, and KFC, though. Shocker! After we met up we walked around a little and then got some beers for $1 each and dinner at a Pho place nearby. Apparently there are a lot of Vietnamese immigrants in the Czech Republic.\nThe next morning I went to the tourist sights: the castle \u0026amp; the Charles Bridge. Both were crawling with tourists, but it was surprising that the side streets even just a few blocks off of the main drag were totally dead. In the afternoon, we met up again for lunch. $5 for goulash and bread dumplings. It still amazes me how cheap food has been so far \u0026ndash; pretty consistently $5-7 per meal, and even less for breakfast.\nOlomouc wasn\u0026rsquo;t nearly as busy as Prague. It\u0026rsquo;s a small city in the eastern part of the Czech Republic, and was conveniently about halfway between Prague and Krakow. I stayed one night at a hostel called Long Story Short, which was unbelievably nice. Seriously. Look it up (I\u0026rsquo;ll link it here when I can use my computer). The Christmas market in Olomouc was warm and had some good Czech food, and there was a huge Gothic(?) cathedral, but otherwise there wasn\u0026rsquo;t a ton going on. I got dinner at a brewery that served a bunch of types of unfiltered beer that was full of locals, which was pretty cool. Then, yesterday, I killed a little more time walking around the city and some parks, and then got on my bus to Krakow.\nLast night was my first night in a party hostel, and it seems super cool. I met people from Colombia, Chile, Australia, Italy, and the States, and everyone was hanging out, eating, drinking, and having a good time. The hostel organized a pub crawl for about $10, but I opted to go to bed early because I set an alarm at 6:00 this morning.\nToday was Auschwitz. It\u0026rsquo;s worse than you could even imagine. The gravity of what happened here really sets in when you walk through the main gate with \u0026ldquo;Albeit Macht Frei\u0026rdquo; above it. They have exhibits about all of the different things that went on at Auschwitz and during the Holocaust in general set up in the old barracks buildings. Maybe appropriately, it was freezing, cloudy, snowing the whole time. Going in, I didn\u0026rsquo;t realize that Hitler wasn\u0026rsquo;t only after Jews and Gypsies, but also wanted to entirely exterminate the Polish population, including turning Warsaw from a huge capital into a provincial town. He almost succeeded, and killed almost three million Polish Jews in the process \u0026ndash; about 90% of the total Jewish population of Poland. I won\u0026rsquo;t get into the details of what happened at Auschwitz, but it\u0026rsquo;s definitely a site worth seeing. The shoes, clothes, and hair (yes) of the prisoners was pretty difficult to bear.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll probably write another of these in a few days when I get to Budapest \u0026ndash; we\u0026rsquo;ll see. As usual, exude the many typos that are probably in here. Writing on my phone isn\u0026rsquo;t easy.\n","date":"2018-12-24","permalink":"https://mrkaye97.github.io/blog/post/2021-01-02-prague-olomouc-and-auschwitz/","tags":["travel","solo","solo travel","europe"],"title":"Prague, Olomouc, and Auschwitz"},{"content":"It\u0026rsquo;s 5:43AM in Vienna, and I can\u0026rsquo;t sleep. Jet lag. So far, so good on my trip. The flight here went surprisingly well \u0026ndash; I woke up and was about an hour from landing in Zurich, which was unexpected and much appreciated. Flying in and out of ZRH was just about all I could ask for in a connection. The views of the Alps and snow-dusted cities and towns from the air are unbelievable. ZRH lived up to its (Swiss) reputation: clean, well-organized, easy to navigate, and overall very efficient. One weird thing about the flight in, though: we didn\u0026rsquo;t fill out immigration cards on the flight in to Zurich from JFK. Maybe that is normal in Switzerland?\nAnyways, I made it to Vienna in one piece, and Wombats' Naschmarkt is a very nice hostel (although it\u0026rsquo;s absolutely huge). My roommates are friendly and everything is clean and comfortable.\nLast night, after getting all of my stuff set up, I roamed around the city a while. There was a line at a stand selling würstl, so I got one of those and explored some of the Christmas markets. The ones at Karlsplatz and especially Stephansplatz were massive and very busy. Two of my roommates and I wound up going back to Karlsplatz later last night for some beer, mulled wine, and an open-faced sandwich with what looked like raw bacon on it. All went well \u0026ndash; mulled wine is what I imagine the kings and queens of old drinking, and where more appropriate to try it for the first time than an outdoor Christmas market in the old capital of the Austrian Empire?\nSide note: I\u0026rsquo;ve been taking a lot of photos but don\u0026rsquo;t know how to embed them into these HTML posts from my phone, but will post some when I get home.\nAfter some thought, I opted to create a public link to my Google Photos album, for anyone who wants to see all of the photos I took on my trip.

I\u0026rsquo;m flying into Vienna, and then am heading to Prague, Olomouc, Krakow, Budapest, and Salzburg. I\u0026rsquo;ll be staying in hostels all along the way, and could not be more excited. This is my first real solo trip (something I\u0026rsquo;ve been wanting to do for a while), so it should be a great experience. I\u0026rsquo;m going to try to post updates along the way of what I\u0026rsquo;m seeing and doing, but I\u0026rsquo;m not totally sure whether or not I will bring my computer. If not, I\u0026rsquo;m definitely going to write a trip update when I get back stateside.\nPeople always ask why I would go somewhere solo. It\u0026rsquo;s a fair question, especially since most people aren\u0026rsquo;t used to seeing sights, eating, and generally being alone in new places. They associate solo travel with being lonely. I get it \u0026ndash; It seems like I\u0026rsquo;ll be going to Europe for three weeks with nothing but my thoughts to keep me company. This seems like a little bit of a misconception. Sure, I\u0026rsquo;ll techincally be travelling alone, but I\u0026rsquo;ll have plenty of other solo travellers staying in the hostels with me to hang out with. Not only that, but going places solo has its own benefits. I went to Toronto alone on my drive out to Minnesota for school this year, and when I was there I found that being able to wake up, eat, and go where I want, when I want can be very liberating: no waiting around for other people or making compromises on how to spend the days. I loved being able to spend my days in Toronto like that.\nIn any case, we\u0026rsquo;ll see how it goes. Hopefully this is the first a lifetime of solo trips.\n","date":"2018-11-25","permalink":"https://mrkaye97.github.io/blog/post/2021-01-02-solo-trip-to-europe-in-december-2018/","tags":["travel","solo","solo travel","europe"],"title":"Solo Trip to Europe in December, 2018"}]
