[{"content":"It\u0026rsquo;s 5:43AM in Vienna, and I can\u0026rsquo;t sleep. Jet lag. So far, so good on my trip. The flight here went surprisingly well \u0026ndash; I woke up and was about an hour from landing in Zurich, which was unexpected and much appreciated. Flying in and out of ZRH was just about all I could ask for in a connection. The views of the Alps and snow-dusted cities and towns from the air are unbelievable. ZRH lived up to its (Swiss) reputation: clean, well-organized, easy to navigate, and overall very efficient. One weird thing about the flight in, though: we didn\u0026rsquo;t fill out immigration cards on the flight in to Zurich from JFK. Maybe that is normal in Switzerland?\nAnyways, I made it to Vienna in one piece, and Wombats' Naschmarkt is a very nice hostel (although it\u0026rsquo;s absolutely huge). My roommates are friendly and everything is clean and comfortable.\nLast night, after getting all of my stuff set up, I roamed around the city a while. There was a line at a stand selling w√ºrstl, so I got one of those and explored some of the Christmas markets. The ones at Karlsplatz and especially Stephansplatz were massive and very busy. Two of my roommates and I wound up going back to Karlsplatz later last night for some beer, mulled wine, and an open-faced sandwich with what looked like raw bacon on it. All went well \u0026ndash; mulled wine is what I imagine the kings and queens of old drinking, and where more appropriate to try it for the first time than an outdoor Christmas market in the old capital of the Austrian Empire?\nSide note: I\u0026rsquo;ve been taking a lot of photos but don\u0026rsquo;t know how to embed them into these HTML posts from my phone, but will post some when I get home.\nAfter some thought, I opted to create a public link to my Google Photos album, for anyone who wants to see all of the photos I took on my trip. Enjoy!\nGoogle Photos Album\n","date":"2018-12-20","permalink":"https://mrkaye97.github.io/blog/post/2021-01-02-first-days-zrh-and-vienna/","tags":["solo","travel","solo travel","europe"],"title":"First Days -- ZRH and Vienna"},{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;m going to Europe in a few weeks! I\u0026rsquo;m flying into Vienna, and then am heading to Prague, Olomouc, Krakow, Budapest, and Salzburg. I\u0026rsquo;ll be staying in hostels all along the way, and could not be more excited. This is my first real solo trip (something I\u0026rsquo;ve been wanting to do for a while), so it should be a great experience. I\u0026rsquo;m going to try to post updates along the way of what I\u0026rsquo;m seeing and doing, but I\u0026rsquo;m not totally sure whether or not I will bring my computer. If not, I\u0026rsquo;m definitely going to write a trip update when I get back stateside.\nPeople always ask why I would go somewhere solo. It\u0026rsquo;s a fair question, especially since most people aren\u0026rsquo;t used to seeing sights, eating, and generally being alone in new places. They associate solo travel with being lonely. I get it \u0026ndash; It seems like I\u0026rsquo;ll be going to Europe for three weeks with nothing but my thoughts to keep me company. This seems like a little bit of a misconception. Sure, I\u0026rsquo;ll techincally be travelling alone, but I\u0026rsquo;ll have plenty of other solo travellers staying in the hostels with me to hang out with. Not only that, but going places solo has its own benefits. I went to Toronto alone on my drive out to Minnesota for school this year, and when I was there I found that being able to wake up, eat, and go where I want, when I want can be very liberating: no waiting around for other people or making compromises on how to spend the days. I loved being able to spend my days in Toronto like that.\nIn any case, we\u0026rsquo;ll see how it goes. Hopefully this is the first a lifetime of solo trips.\n","date":"2018-11-25","permalink":"https://mrkaye97.github.io/blog/post/2021-01-02-solo-trip-to-europe-in-december-2018/","tags":["travel","solo","solo travel","europe"],"title":"Solo Trip to Europe in December, 2018"}]
