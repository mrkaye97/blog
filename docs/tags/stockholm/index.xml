      <description>This is a blog post Q&amp;amp;A I wrote for the Swedish Program blog. You can find the original post here.
Housing is a big part of your study abroad experience. At The Swedish Program, we offer students the choice of an apartment or host family, both of which provide opportunities for cultural integration. It can be tough to decide which option is right for you, so we asked Fall 2019 student Matt Kaye (Carleton College â€˜19) to describe his experience living with a host family.
Tell us about your host family. I lived with the Grahm family in Bromma (about 30 minutes west of SSE by metro).</description>
