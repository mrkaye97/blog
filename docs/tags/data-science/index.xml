      <description>Introduction Our project aims to measure the ability of defensive backs at performing different aspects of their defensive duties: deterring targets (either by reputation or through good positioning), closing down receivers, and breaking up passes. We do this by fitting four models, two for predicting the probability that a receiver will be targeted on a given play and two for predicting the probability that a pass will be caught, which we then use to aggregate the contributions of defensive backs over the course of the season.
Modeling Framework We opted to use XGBoost for all of our models. At a high level, we chose a tree booster for its ability to find complex interactions between predictors, something we anticipated would be necessary for this project.</description>
