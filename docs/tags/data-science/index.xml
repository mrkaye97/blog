      <description>rstudio::global, this year&amp;rsquo;s iteration of the annual RStudio conference, was a few weeks ago. Here were some highlights:
Talks There were a few talks I really loved:
 Using R to Up Your Experimentation Game, by Shirbi Ish-Shalom. On experimentation, sequential testing, taking big swings, and being statistically rigorous Maintaining the House the Tidyverse Built, by Hadley Wickham. On building and maintaining the Tidyverse, and what package maintenance in the real world is like when you have millions of downloads.</description>

      <description>Introduction slackr 2.1.0+ is live! There are a whole bunch of exciting changes that we (mostly Andrie de Vries and I) have made to improve the package a bunch.
Changes Here are some of the things that are new in slackr 2.1.0+. For more info on the package, check out the Github repo and the pkgdown site.
Ease of Use Improvements  We&amp;rsquo;ve dramatically improved error messaging, so long gone are the days of errors like No &#39;id&#39; column found in &#39;x&#39;!</description>

      <title>Putting R Into Production</title>

      <description>Introduction As promised, this post is going to cover how we productionize R at CollegeVine. As I said before, I&amp;rsquo;m exclusively using R for my data science work at CV, which means that we needed to come up with a way to get over the &amp;ldquo;R is hard to productionize!&amp;rdquo; obstacle. Here&amp;rsquo;s how we do it.
Building a Modeling Pipeline What I&amp;rsquo;ve found to be the most important piece of productionizing the work that I do is having a rock-solid pipeline set up to make everyone&amp;rsquo;s life easier.</description>

      <title>Why I Write R, and Why You Should Too</title>

      <description>Introduction I write R all the time. All of my work is done in R (yes, that includes productionizing models), I write R for fun, I maintain an R package and am the author of another, and I wrote this post in R Markdown. But, why? If you peruse blogs on Towards Data Science or r/datascience, you&amp;rsquo;ll find person after person telling new data scientists or data scientists-in-training to learn python instead of R.</description>

      <description>Introduction Every other Friday at work, we have a meeting called All Hands, during the first half of which a member of the team gives a presentation. The presentation is split up into two pieces: A personal presentation &amp;ndash; your favorite food, TV shows, books, etc. &amp;ndash; and a mini-lesson, which can be about any topic of interest that&amp;rsquo;s unrelated to work. Yesterday it was my turn, and I gave my mini-lesson on Markov Chains and Markov Chain Monte Carlo.</description>

      <description>Meta This post is my team&amp;rsquo;s 2021 NFL Big Data Bowl submission. My team was made up of me, Hugh McCreery (Baltimore Orioles), John Edwards (Seattle Mariners), and Owen McGrattan (DS student at Berkeley). I&amp;rsquo;m proud of what we&amp;rsquo;ve put forth here, and hopefully you find it interesting. At the end (after the Appendix), I&amp;rsquo;ve added some overall thoughs on things we were curious about or feel like we could have done better, as well as what we view as the biggest strengths and weaknesses of our submission.</description>
