      <description>Introduction Markov Chains Markov Chain Monte Carlo Recap   Introduction Every other Friday at work, we have a meeting called All Hands, during the first half of which a member of the team gives a presentation. The presentation is split up into two pieces: A personal presentation – your favorite food, TV shows, books, etc. – and a mini-lesson, which can be about any topic of interest that’s unrelated to work.</description>

      <description>Introduction Our project aims to measure the ability of defensive backs at performing different aspects of their defensive duties: deterring targets (either by reputation or through good positioning), closing down receivers, and breaking up passes. We do this by fitting four models, two for predicting the probability that a receiver will be targeted on a given play and two for predicting the probability that a pass will be caught, which we then use to aggregate the contributions of defensive backs over the course of the season.</description>
