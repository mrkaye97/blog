      <description>Introduction slackr 2.1.0+ is live! There are a whole bunch of exciting changes that we (mostly Andrie de Vries and I) have made to improve the package a bunch.
Changes Here are some of the things that are new in slackr 2.1.0+. For more info on the package, check out the Github repo and the pkgdown site.
Ease of Use Improvements  We&amp;rsquo;ve dramatically improved error messaging, so long gone are the days of errors like No &#39;id&#39; column found in &#39;x&#39;!</description>

      <description>Introduction As promised, this post is going to cover how we productionize R at CollegeVine. As I said before, I&amp;rsquo;m exclusively using R for my data science work at CV, which means that we needed to come up with a way to get over the &amp;ldquo;R is hard to productionize!&amp;rdquo; obstacle. Here&amp;rsquo;s how we do it.
Building a Modeling Pipeline What I&amp;rsquo;ve found to be the most important piece of productionizing the work that I do is having a rock-solid pipeline set up to make everyone&amp;rsquo;s life easier.</description>

      <description>Introduction I write R all the time. All of my work is done in R (yes, that includes productionizing models), I write R for fun, I maintain an R package and am the author of another, and I wrote this post in R Markdown. But, why? If you peruse blogs on Towards Data Science or r/datascience, you&amp;rsquo;ll find person after person telling new data scientists or data scientists-in-training to learn python instead of R.</description>
