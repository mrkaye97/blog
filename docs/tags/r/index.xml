      <description>rstudio::global, this year&amp;rsquo;s iteration of the annual RStudio conference, was a few weeks ago. Here were some highlights:
Talks There were a few talks I really loved:
 Using R to Up Your Experimentation Game, by Shirbi Ish-Shalom. On experimentation, sequential testing, taking big swings, and being statistically rigorous Maintaining the House the Tidyverse Built, by Hadley Wickham. On building and maintaining the Tidyverse, and what package maintenance in the real world is like when you have millions of downloads.</description>

      <description>Introduction slackr 2.1.0+ is live! There are a whole bunch of exciting changes that we (mostly Andrie de Vries and I) have made to improve the package a bunch.
Changes Here are some of the things that are new in slackr 2.1.0+. For more info on the package, check out the Github repo and the pkgdown site.
Ease of Use Improvements  We&amp;rsquo;ve dramatically improved error messaging, so long gone are the days of errors like No &#39;id&#39; column found in &#39;x&#39;!</description>

      <description>Introduction I write R all the time. All of my work is done in R (yes, that includes productionizing models), I write R for fun, I maintain an R package and am the author of another, and I wrote this post in R Markdown. But, why? If you peruse blogs on Towards Data Science or r/datascience, you&amp;rsquo;ll find person after person telling new data scientists or data scientists-in-training to learn python instead of R.</description>
