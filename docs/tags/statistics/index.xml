      <description>Introduction I write R all the time. All of my work is done in R (yes, that includes productionizing models), I write R for fun, I maintain an R package and am the author of another, and I wrote this post in R Markdown. But, why?

The presentation is split up into two pieces: A personal presentation &amp;ndash; your favorite food, TV shows, books, etc. &amp;ndash; and a mini-lesson, which can be about any topic of interest that&amp;rsquo;s unrelated to work. Yesterday it was my turn, and I gave my mini-lesson on Markov Chains and Markov Chain Monte Carlo.</description>
