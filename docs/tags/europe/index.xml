      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m now finishing up my third week in Stockholm &amp;ndash; time flies. Week 1 was mostly orientation: learning a little bit of Swedish, meeting the other group members, starting to find our way around the city, etc. We trekked out to Sandhamn, an island in the Archipelago, for the first weekend. Really beautiful spot. Weeks 2 and 3 were the start of classes &amp;ndash; 3 program classes and 1 SSE class.</description>

      <description>I just got back from a two and a half week solo trip to Europe. I did a circuit from Vienna, to Prague, Olomouc, Krakow, Budapest, and back to Vienna. These are some of my reflections on the experience.
Pre-Trip Pre-trip I was planning on, well, planning. I had all of my hostels booked, some activities planned, transporation figured out, etc. In hindsight, I planned too much, but more on that later.</description>
