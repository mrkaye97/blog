      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m now finishing up my third week in Stockholm &amp;ndash; time flies. Week 1 was mostly orientation: learning a little bit of Swedish, meeting the other group members, starting to find our way around the city, etc. We trekked out to Sandhamn, an island in the Archipelago, for the first weekend. Really beautiful spot. Weeks 2 and 3 were the start of classes &amp;ndash; 3 program classes and 1 SSE class. Overall, so far, so good.
A few of the biggest highlights so far:
 Meeting my host family. They&amp;rsquo;re great! Very welcoming and we&amp;rsquo;ve been getting along super well. Dinner parties.</description>
