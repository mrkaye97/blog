      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s 5:43AM in Vienna, and I can&amp;rsquo;t sleep. Jet lag. So far, so good on my trip. The flight here went surprisingly well &amp;ndash; I woke up and was about an hour from landing in Zurich, which was unexpected and much appreciated. Flying in and out of ZRH was just about all I could ask for in a connection. The views of the Alps and snow-dusted cities and towns from the air are unbelievable. ZRH lived up to its (Swiss) reputation: clean, well-organized, easy to navigate, and overall very efficient. One weird thing about the flight in, though: we didn&amp;rsquo;t fill out immigration cards on the flight in to Zurich from JFK.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m going to Europe in a few weeks! I&amp;rsquo;m flying into Vienna, and then am heading to Prague, Olomouc, Krakow, Budapest, and Salzburg. I&amp;rsquo;ll be staying in hostels all along the way, and could not be more excited. This is my first real solo trip (something I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to do for a while), so it should be a great experience. I&amp;rsquo;m going to try to post updates along the way of what I&amp;rsquo;m seeing and doing, but I&amp;rsquo;m not totally sure whether or not I will bring my computer. If not, I&amp;rsquo;m definitely going to write a trip update when I get back stateside.</description>
